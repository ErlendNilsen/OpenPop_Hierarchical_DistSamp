Avg_detect_Map.pdf
------------------
Posterior medians (page 1), standard deviations (SD, page 2), and coefficients of variation (CV = SD / mean, page 3)
of area-specific average detection decay parameters across Norway (visualized at municipality level).
Darker colors indicate higher medians and higher uncertainty. 


Avg_pSurv_Map.pdf
-----------------
Posterior medians (page 1), standard deviations (SD, page 2), and coefficients of variation (CV = SD / mean, page 3)
of area-specific average survival probabilities across Norway (visualized at municipality level). 
Darker colors indicate higher medians and higher uncertainty. 


Avg_rRep_Map.pdf
----------------
Posterior medians (page 1), standard deviations (SD, page 2), and coefficients of variation (CV = SD / mean, page 3)
of area-specific average recruitment rates across Norway (visualized at municipality level). 
Darker colors indicate higher medians and higher uncertainty. 


betaR_Map.pdf
-------------
Posterior medians (page 1), standard deviations (SD, page 2), and coefficients of variation (CV = SD / mean, page 3)
of area-specific average recruitment rates across Norway (visualized at municipality level). 
On page 1, more reddish colors indicate positive effects and more greenish colors indicate negative effects.
On pages 2 & 3, darker colors indicate higher uncertainty. 


postDens_tS_tR.pdf
------------------
Posterior distributions for A) average (blue) and year-specific (orange) survival probabilities and
B) average (yellow) and year-specific (teal) recruitment rates.
Each page corresponds to one reporting area, the name of which can be found in the top left corner of plots. 


Rep_betaR.R.pdf
---------------
Posterior medians (lines) and 95% credible intervals (ribbons) of area-specific recruitment rates predicted 
as functions of local rodent abundance. Rodent abundance is approximated using occupancy, i.e. the proportion
of transect lines on which small rodents were observed during surveys. 


TimeSeries_pDetect.pdf
----------------------
Posterior medians (lines) and 95% credible intervals (ribbons) of detection probability across time. 
The opaque blue area marks the period of time for which line transect surveys have been conducted in the area.
Each page corresponds to one reporting area, the name of which can be found in the top left corner of plots. 


TimeSeries_popDens1.pdf
-----------------------
Posterior medians (lines) and 95% credible intervals (ribbons) of population density across time. 
The opaque blue area marks the period of time for which line transect surveys have been conducted in the area.
Each page corresponds to one reporting area, the name of which can be found in the top left corner of plots. 


TimeSeries_pSurv.pdf
--------------------
Posterior medians (lines) and 95% credible intervals (ribbons) of survival probability across time. 
The opaque blue area marks the period of time for which line transect surveys have been conducted in the area.
Each page corresponds to one reporting area, the name of which can be found in the top left corner of plots. 


TimeSeries_rRep.pdf
-------------------
Posterior medians (lines) and 95% credible intervals (ribbons) of recruitment rate across time. 
The opaque blue area marks the period of time for which line transect surveys have been conducted in the area.
