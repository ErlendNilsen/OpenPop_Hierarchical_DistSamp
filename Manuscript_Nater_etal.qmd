# Abstract

# Introduction

-   There is a growing need/demand for indicators for biodiversity, species abundance and demographic rates (see e.g. EBVs)

-   On one hand, these indicators need to be representative at large scales

-   This for e.g. international reporting towards biodiversity targets

-   On the other hand, indicators with decent spatial resolution are also needed

-   The reason for that is that that is the relevant scale for local-level managements and planning

-   This goes both for development decisions and species management and conservation (which typically happen at a county or even municipality level)

-   Besides organisational scale, there is also spatial variation not only in biodiversity, but also in population dynamics and life history of (target) species

-   This variation needs to be accounted for to develop successful and sustainable (harvest) management and conservation strategies

-   There is clear need for large-scale and spatially explicit indicators, but their development hinges on the availability of data from large-scale and long-term monitoring programmes

-   Several countries (in Europe) have been working towards setting up such programmes and been successful particularly for monitoring of some species groups, i.e. breeding birds and butterflies

-   Unfortunately, most of these monitoring programmes te limited to presence-absence or very simple count observations, making them suitable for the development of indicators of distribution and population trends, but usually not for indicators of abundance, population dynamics, and demographic rates

-   The primary reason here is that large-scale long-term monitoring programmes are very costly to run, in particular when they need to be carried out by specialists

-   Citizen science, i.e. the collection of ecological data by members of the public, has been growing rapidly and providing data at larger spatial and taxonomic scales than previously possible.

-   However, increased coverage and total sampling effort in citizen science monitoring often comes at the cost of data being presence-only and prone to bias, limiting usefulness in particular for the study of population dynamics and demography.

-   The exception are monitoring programmes that make use of a large number of citizen scientists that have been trained to collect data and record metadata in a structured manner and according to a carefully designed protocol (+ 1-2 internationally "widely known" programmes?)

-   Norway has one such monitoring programme that focuses on terrestrial gamebird species: Hønsefugltakseringen (needs an English name)

-   Brief intro of monitoring programme: sampling design (mention age- and sex- assigment), coverage, data handling, OA publishing of data

-   Brief intro of previously developed modelling framework: integrated distance sampling model using age-specific line transect data and auxiliary telemetry data to get estimates of population size and structure, as well as key vital rates (survival, recruitment), over time

-   Combined, national-scale monitoring and this modelling framework have potential for large-scale high-resolution modelling of population dynamics and its demographic and environmental drivers

-   In this study, we extended model of Nielsen & Nater 2023 to run not just on a single area but all areas with publicly available line transect data simultaneously

-   Capitalize on "sharing information" across locations and effectively space-for-time substitution to estimate population size, age-structure, survival, and recruitment across 41 reporting districts and 15 years (2007-2021) for willow ptarmigan

The willow ptarmigan (*Lagopus lagopus*) has a circumpolar distribution, mainly inhabiting sub-alpine and arctic ecosystems [see e.g. @fuglei2020]. While the species is currently listed as Least Concern (LC) both in the global and Norwegian red list of species, it has undergone rather dramatic declines in abundance in Norway since the turn of the 20th century [@hjeljord2022]. While the main reason for the long-term decline in abundance remain unresolved, they are considered sentinel species that are sensitive to both climate change and land use management [@Henden2017; @Storch2007]. Moreover, being one of only a handful of bird species that spend the winter in mountain ecosystems in Scandinavia, they are important components of the ecosystem as prey species for the gyrfalcon [@Alastair2020]. The willow ptarmigan has a relatively fast pace of life [@sandercock2005; @Steen1996], and can have substantial spatio-temporal variation in demographic rates [@Bowler2020]. Their population dynamics are characterized by large inter-annual fluctuations in abundance [@hjeljord2022], and previous research has tied these fluctuations to rodent cycle through shared predators [@hagen1952; @Bowler2020]. This tight relationship between the breeding success of ground nesting birds and the rodent cycle is known as the Alternative Prey Hypothesis and has been a central part of Fennoscandian research on grouse population dynamics for many decades [@hagen1952; @Linden1988: @Steen1985]. In addition, spring weather conditions and phenology is known to have considerable effects on breeding success and recruitment rates [@Eriksen2023, @Steen1985]. Across their distributional range, they are iconic species with a high cultural value, partly linked to their popularity as game species. The fact that they are valued game species, information about spatio-temporal variation in demographic rates and population dynamics is particularly important in order to design sustainable harvest strategies. In addition, as a sentinel species the willow ptarmigan is well suited as an indicator species for ecosystem status; in Norway it is in fact included in both the main national biodiversity (Nature Index for Norway; refs) and ecosystem (Assessment of the Ecological Condition; refs) assessments. The model presented here therefore potentially has direct application in real world management and conservation contexts.

# Methods

## Study species

-   Willow ptarmigan distribution, life history, and (historical) abundance

## Data collection, management, and preparation

### Line transect sampling

The line transect survey data were collected through a structured participatory monitoring program called "Hønsefuglportalen" (<https://honsefugl.nina.no/Innsyn/en>). In August each year, trained volunteer fieldworkers collect willow ptarmigan observations along predefined line transects. To increase the detection probability, each team of fieldworkers use a pointing dog to locate the birds. Each survey team typically consist of at least two persons (one dog handler and one person responsible for following the transect line) and one dog. Often, more than one dog is used for a survey, but only one dog should be used at a time. The transect lines vary in length, but is typically between x and y km (range: xx, mean: yy). When an observation is made, the exact location of observation is noted, along with perpendicular distance to the transect line, and the age- and sex of the observed birds. An observation typically include 1 - 12 birds (mean = ?), representing one brood (female and or male with young-of-the-year chicks). When the surveys are conducted in August, the chicks of the year are able to fly but can be distinguished from older birds as they are still of smaller body size. Since 2019, most of the data has been collected using a mobile app tailored made for the monitoring program, where the field workers can register and get access to the transect lines allocated to them by the local organizers. Before 2019, data were collected on a dedicated field form, and entered manually in a web portal. After field data has been collected, several steps of quality control takes place before, both by local stakeholders and personnel from NINA. Surveys are carried out on both public and private land. After an initial embargo period, all data from public land are published and made freely available as a sampling-event data set on GBIF (refs). This data set contain both meta data about the transect surveys (survey date, line transect length and location, study area ID and other information) as well as data pertaining to the observations (species, number of birds of different categories (adult males, adult females, juveniles, and birds of unknown category), perpendicular distance to transect line, exact location, and time of observation). For this study, we used only data from public land that is freely available on GBIF; thus the workflow we describe should be fully reproducible by others. Formally, the data is publsihed as three distinct data sets, based on the three main public land owners (Statskog, FeFo and Fjellstyrene, respectively).

The program is not designed as a national monitoring, but rather a collection of local and regional survey programs. All involved survey areas use a common field protocol and data collection model. In addition, the local study designs are reviewed by staff at NINA, and common recommendations for study design is provided. However, both a local scale and in particular at a regional scale, the design is unbalanced due to the fact that participation in voluntary by stakeholders. In general, the effort is higher in South-Eastern and Central Norway, medium in Northern Norway, and in general low in Western and Southern Norway. In total, we used data from Xx different survey areas, across xx counties and xx municipalities.

### Radio-telemetry study in Lierne

In our model, we integrated data from an ongoing field study of marked birds in Lierne municipality in Central Norway. These data were used to inform the survival component of the model (se below). The data is based on a sample of radio marked birds. The birds were captured in winter (late February or early March each year in the study period), and fitted with VHF collars. The marked birds were monitored on a regular basis until they either i) died, ii) battery stopped working, or iii) we lost contact with the bird for other reasons. For most of the year, the birds were monitored at least monthly. However, during the breeding and chick-rearing season (May to July) the birds were monitored more often, and during december and January we obtained few observations due to challenging field work conditions. A proportion of the birds were harvest annually in the regular recreational harvest, and birds that were harvested were reported as shot to the field personnel. In addition, as the collars had mortality switch, we were also able to locate and retrieve a high proportion of birds that died for natural causes. We used data from the years 2015 - 2021, and the total sample size across these years was xx birds. The study is described in detail in @Israelsen2020 and in @Arnekleiv2022.

## National-scale integrated model

### Integrated distance sampling model (IDSM) for willow ptarmigan

-   Introduction of integrated Distance sampling model (IDSM) from MS1

### Multi-area model extension

-   Addition of spatial dimension
-   Hyper-parameter distributions for spatial variation
-   Temporal variation (shared year RE and "residual" variation)

The model developed as part of this project and presented in @nilsen2023 was designed with the potential of extension to run on data from multiple areas simultaneously in mind, and this extension involves two steps in practice.

The first step is the inclusion of an additional dimension, area, to enable using data collected from multiple areas (@fig-model). The area-dimension is added across all model components with the exception of the known-fate telemetry data (and seasonal decomposition of survival estimated from it), as that is only available for the Lierne area.

The pink "x"'s indicate the added dimension for area. Juv\[x,t\] = juveniles in year t. Ad\[x,t\] = adults in year t. R\[x,t\] = recruitment rate in year t. S\[x,t\] = survival probability from year t to t+1.](Figures/RypeIDSM_multiArea_structure.png){#fig-model}

The second step is making adjustments to capitalize on the integration of data from multiple areas to make maximal use of available information. There are several not mutually exclusive options for approaching this, and one of them is the use of "hyper-parameters" for sharing information across areas [e.g. @horswill2019; @horswill2021]. As an illustrative example, take the area-specific average annual survival probability, $\mu^S_x$. Instead of assigning independent non-informative priors to each $\mu^S_x$, we now assume that the variation in average survival across space can be described by a common (logit) normal distribution such that:

$$
\begin{equation}
\mu^S_x \sim Normal(logit(h.\mu^S), h.\sigma^S)
\end{equation}
$$ where $h.\mu^S$ is the "hyper mean" and $h.\sigma^S$ is the "hyper standard deviation". Non-informative priors are then assigned to the hyper-parameters instead of the area-specific realizations:

$$
\begin{align}
h.\mu^S & \sim Uniform(0,1) \\
h.\sigma^S & \sim Uniform(0, 5)
\end{align}
$$

For the multi-area implementation of the IDSM, we used the equivalent of the above approach for parameters representing average survival probabilities, baseline recruitment rates, rodent effect on recruitment, and average distance sampling detection. Initial population density, on the other hand, was estimated independently for each area. Random effects standard deviations were assumed to be the same for all areas, effectively resulting in space-for-time subtitution for random effect estimation.

Another approach to maximising information gain when jointly analysing data from different areas is explicit modelling of spatial and spatio-temporal variation.

### Model implementation

## Reproducible workflow with "targets"

Reproducibility and ease of repeating analyses was a key focus when developing the multi-area IDSM.To that end, we set up the workflow as a "targets pipeline", implemented throught the R packages "targets" [@landau2021]. A visual representation of the pipeline is displayed in @fig-workflow.

# Results

## Population density

@fig-densA shows that population density is generally lowest in the Northern parts of Norway and highest in central Norway, close to the Swedish borders. Higher median density estimates also seem to be associated with higher estimation uncertainty (@fig-densB) and therefore have to be interpreted with care.

## Population growth rate

In most areas, populations of willow ptarmigan have been increasing over the period 2018-2020, potentially indicating a positive effect of more restricted hunting in recent years (@fig-lam). Some areas -- predominantly in central Norway -- also had declining populations, but many of those declines followed upon a period of increase between the start of data colection in 2007 and sometime between 2016 and 2018.

In b) darker colors indicate higher median values and higher uncertainty.

## Survival probability

Annual survival probabilities ranged from aroung 35% to 50% across reporting areas in Norway, with the highest values occurring in the far north and in the mountains in the south (@fig-pSurv).

:::

## Recruitment rate

Annual recruitment rates showed a spatial pattern (@fig-rRep) that was inverse relative to that of annual survival (@fig-pSurv), with lower recruitment rates co-occurring with higher survival rates and vice-versa. This is consistent with basic life history theory [@stearns1992] and with previous studies finding relatively slower life histories in alpine / high altitude areas [e.g. @sandercock2005; @bears2009; @alice2016].

## Effects of rodent occupancy

The model predicted substantial variation in the effect of the rodent occupancy covariate on recruitment (@fig-betaR). Areas in the north and south west generally had recruitment increasing with rodent occupancy while the remaining areas were a mosaic of positive and negative effects, albeit with some spatial clustering.

# Discussion

## Abundance and vital rates across space and time

-   Biological results (interpretations and comparisons with other case studies / species / systems)
-   With some focus on what we are able to get insights on thanks to the integration across time and space (i.e. better estimates through data sharing, relative importance of different kinds of variation, etc. )

## Implications for management (preliminary section title)

-   What results mean for management (of habitat and of harvest)

## Model limitations and outlook

-   Some limitations of "base model" that need mentioning (e.g. age assignment, ignoring potential effects of flock size on detection)

-   Limited usefulness of auxiliary radio-telemetry data as only from one area (big potential for including additional datasets from other small-scale studies, telemetry but also other, e.g. nest monitoring?)

-   Outlook: improved modelling of spatio-temporal patterns through correlated REs

Another approach to maximising information gain when jointly analysing data from different areas is explicit modelling of spatial and spatio-temporal variation. While this is commonly done for modern species distribution models [e.g. @pacifici2017; @guelat2018], it has rarely been implemented in demographic models. This is not least due to the fact that few demographic models span large spatial extents. Since our IDSM and the willow ptarmigan data do actually do that though, extending the framework to account for spatial and spatiotemporal correlations may be feasible. Per now, we have not yet attempted this, but are planning to do so in the near future. (BUT: we do already have some computational limitations now, so likely to need development of more efficient sampling strategies. Which is fortunately possible with NIMBLE but there is a chance that another platform, e.g. INLA, may be required)

-   Outlook: integration with / coupling to models for harvest to develop tools for (automatic) calculation of e.g. hunting quotas

## Reproducible workflows for a sustainable future

-   Structure / setup of this workflow (from data collection to analytical results)
-   Why this matters: transparency and credibility, feedback to volunteer data collectors, cost-effective to re-do analyses for annual/regular reporting, easy to re-use and build upon, publicly accessible and well documented to allow more effective resource use in follow-up projects (sustainable use of funding), etc.
-   Also: useful to link up to different reporting routes and/or more general (multi-indicator) projects

## Conclusion

-   Summarise neatly
-   Things worth highlighting: inference across large spatial scale but with "useful" resolution for management, advantages of integration across space (we can estimate better and more), integration of small locality-specific datasets with large national-scale monitoring, importance of reproducible workflows
